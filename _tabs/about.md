Hi. My name's Hasan. I'm primarily a python developer with 2 years of experience with Python and 1 year of experience with SQL/Relational Databases. I had a stint at cisco where I worked on test automation for their routers and learned about networking. I also had experience working with clients at Broadridge where I did general bug fixes and implementation.

I also have a side interest in cybersecurity and have been taking online networking courses and hope to work towards certain certifications to mix software and cybersecurity in some way in my career. I aim to get a cloud certification of some sort (GCP, AWS) as well as IT Certifications like the Security+ but would need hands-on experience in the IT field. 

I am currently open to IT positions, entry-level data analytics, or junior/intermediate software backend roles.

In my spare time, I also enjoy gaming and sometimes works on coding-related projects for my favourite games
